	<h1>Welcome! I'm Erik Klein. This is my digital CV and demo web page. </h1>
	<h2>My Story</h2>
	I always loved thinking. From a young age, I got promoted by organizations for gifted students, like Hector-Seminar, Deutsche JuniorAkademien and Heidelberger Life-Science Lab, and discovered my interest in computer science early. I started programming in 6th grade, and it captivated me since then. I always had the passion to solve problems, learn new technologies and build something visionary and useful.
	<h2>Skills</h2>
	<h3>Algorithm Design</h3>
	I'm an expert at algorithm design, and able to come up with the best algorithms for complex problems. I was one of 20 German pupils to receive an extensive training in competitive programming as part of "IOI-Training" by Bundesweite Informatikwettbewerbe. This included three years of camps, lectures and practice contests. I mastered the following topics:
	<ul>
		<li>Graph and Tree Algorithms</li>
		<li>Dynamic Programming incl. Optimizations</li>
		<li>Data Structures</li>
		<li>Sorting and Searching</li>
		<li>Greedy Algorithms</li>
		<li>Backtracking and Pruning Strategies</li>
		<li>Heuristic Methods</li>
		<li>Brute Force</li>
		<li>Flows</li>
		<li>Combinatorics</li>
	</ul>
	I acquired many skills, including:
	<ul>
		<li>Problem Solving and Analytical Thinking</li>
		<li>Efficiency and Correctness Analysis</li>
		<li>Programming in C++</li>
		<li>Handling Intractable Problems</li>
	</ul>
	I solved more than 1000 olympiad problems and received awards from prestigious multinational competitions for high school students, e.g.
	<ul>
		<li>Central European Olympiad in Informatics (CEOI'21), 3rd place in DACH region. Only top 4 competitors from each country are selected for the team/delegation to participate.</li>
		<li>Baltic Olympiad in Informatics (BOI'21), Participant in German Team (top 6 people)</li>
		<li>USA Computing Olympiad (USACO), Advanced to Gold Division (there are four divisions, from Bronze to Platinum)</li>
		<li>Bundeswettbewerb Informatik (BWINF), Prize Winner at Final Round, Top 12 out of 1700 participants</li>
		<li>Swiss Olympiad in Informatics (SOI), 7th place in first round, with 200 participants</li>
		<li>XVI Moscow Open Olympiad in Programming, one of 400 Finalists out of 1500 participants from CIS-States</li>
		<li>Technocup '20, '21 and '22, Finalist (out of 4500 participants)</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Software Engineering</h3>
	I took the Coursera 3-Course Specialization by Hong Kong University of Science and Technology HKUST, where I learned the theory of:
	<ul>
		<li>Requirements Analysis and Modeling, inc. Use-Case Diagrams</li>
		<li>Defensive Programming, Software Testing and Refactoring</li>
		<li>Agile Methods</li>
		<li>Software Quality</li>
		<li>Software Analysis incl. Analysis Classes</li>
		<li>Software Architecture</li>
		<li>Design Patterns</li>
		<li>Project Management</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Machine Learning</h3>
	I learned multiple data science methods in an openHPI course:
	<ul>
		<li>Different types of Clustering</li>
		<li>Classification Algorithms</li>
		<li>Frequent Itemset Mining, Outlier Mining</li>	
	</ul>
	I took multiple Coursera Courses by Andrew Ng, where I learned:
	<ul>
		<li>Linear Algebra</li>
		<li>Linear and Logistic Regression</li>	
		<li>Theory and Practical Advice of Neural Networks</li>
		<li>Support Vector Machines and their Kernels</li>
		<li>Principal Component Analysis for Dimensionality Reduction</li>
		<li>Anomaly Detection</li>
		<li>Recommender Systems</li>
		<li>Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Other</h3>
	I was educated in a two-year intense course in high school, where I additionally learned:
	<ul>
		<li>Theoretical Computer Science, incl. Automatons, Grammars and Languages</li>
		<li>Computer Networks</li>
		<li>Cryptology incl. Asymmetric Cryptology</li>
		<li>Databases and Relations</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Hobbies</h2>
	My former hobby was chess, and also japanese chess (Shogi). I played every day, and improved my skills so much that I reached 1st Dan master rank (black belt) and became youth champion in Germany three times.
