				<p>I'm a 19 year old from Germany and recently finished my Abiturs. I'm currently doing an internship as a Software Engineer at QAware GmbH in Munich and will start studying Computer Science at TH Rosenheim next semester.</p>
				<p>I always loved thinking. From a young age, I got promoted by organizations for gifted students, like Hector-Seminar, Deutsche JuniorAkademien and Heidelberger Life-Science Lab, and discovered my interest and talent in computer science early. I started programming in 6th grade, and it captivated me since then. I always had the passion to solve problems, learn new technologies and build something visionary and useful.</p>

	<h2>Algorithm Design</h2>
	I'm an expert at algorithm design, and able to come up with the best algorithms for complex problems. I was one of 20 German pupils to receive an extensive training in competitive programming as part of "IOI-Training" by Bundesweite Informatikwettbewerbe. This included three years of camps, lectures and practice contests.
	<figure><img src="lg.png", width="75%"><figcaption>The German IOI-Training Team</figcaption></figure>
	I mastered the following topics:
	<ul>
		<li>Graph and Tree Algorithms</li>
		<li>Dynamic Programming incl. Optimizations</li>
		<li>Data Structures</li>
		<li>Sorting and Searching</li>
		<li>Greedy Algorithms</li>
		<li>Backtracking and Pruning Strategies</li>
		<li>Heuristic Methods</li>
		<li>Brute Force</li>
		<li>Flows</li>
		<li>Combinatorics</li>
		<li>Automatons, Grammars and Languages</li>
	</ul>
	I acquired many skills, including:
	<ul>
		<li>Problem Solving and Analytical Thinking</li>
		<li>Efficiency and Correctness Analysis</li>
		<li>Programming in C++</li>
		<li>Handling Intractable Problems</li>
		<li>Understanding Complex Multi-Layer Systems</li>
	</ul>

		<div class="col-lg-6">
			I solved more than 1000 olympiad problems, was consistently one of the Top 0.3% of high school competitive programmers in Germany and received awards from prestigious multinational competitions for high school students, e.g.
			<ul>
				<li>Central European Olympiad in Informatics (CEOI'21), 3rd place in DACH region. Only top 4 competitors from each country are selected for the team/delegation to participate.</li>
				<li>Baltic Olympiad in Informatics (BOI'21), Participant in German Team (top 6 people)</li>
				<li>USA Computing Olympiad (USACO), Advanced to Gold Division (there are four divisions, from Bronze to Platinum)</li>
				<li>Bundeswettbewerb Informatik (BWINF), Prize Winner at Final Round, Top 12 out of 1700 participants</li>
				<li>Swiss Olympiad in Informatics (SOI), 7th place in first round, with 200 participants</li>

	<h2>Software Engineering</h2>
	I have acqired deep knowledge about the theory of Software Engineering by taking the Coursera 3-Course Specialization by Hong Kong University of Science and Technology HKUST [<a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/HM5DCVYHQ99M" target="_blank">Certificate</a>]. I can apply important concepts from these fields:
	<ul>
		<li>Requirements Analysis and Modeling, inc. UML, Use-Case Diagrams</li>
		<li>Defensive Programming, Software Testing and Refactoring</li>
		<li>Agile Methods, Scrum</li>
		<li>Software Quality</li>
		<li>Software Analysis incl. Analysis Classes</li>
		<li>Software Architecture</li>
		<li>Design Patterns</li>
		<li>Project Management</li>
	</ul>
	I have advanced skills in Java programming and am proficient in version control with Git.
	<p>To strengthen my skills, I was part of the pupil scholarship program by QAware GmbH, a software company known for it's quality, agile development and expertise in cloud technologies. For one year, I was mentored by one of their software engineers, took part in the further education program and worked in a team of pupils on a project.
	To gain more experience, practice and become a better developer, I'll do an 11-week internship at QAware, where I'll work on a real project with senior engineers and architects.</p>
	<p>Previously, I was responisble for a crucial machine learning project at ITscope GmbH, a modern local IT company. I worked for 9 weeks as software developer, and finished the work successfully. The system is now in live-use, has enormous impact (automating the company's processes) and the CEO is very satisfied [<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/2fmr9712pvdgmxx/Arbeitszeugnis_ITscope2021.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank">Reference 2021</a>, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/y2x77sbiiaaa9e6/BescheinigungITscope18.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank">Reference 2018</a>].</p>

	<h3>Full-Stack Web Development</h3>
	<p>Currently I am breaking into web dev, learning the basics in a Coursera course by Johns Hopkins University and taking a Coursera specialization by HKUST. I am fond of these technologies:
	<ul>
		<li>HTML</li>
		<li>CSS</li>
		<li>JavaScript</li>
		<li>Bootstrap</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<h2>Machine Learning</h2>
	<div class="container-fluid">
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-6">
			I learned multiple data science methods in an openHPI course:
			<ul>
				<li>Different types of Clustering</li>
				<li>Classification Algorithms</li>
				<li>Frequent Itemset Mining, Outlier Mining</li>	
			</ul>
			I took multiple Coursera Courses by Andrew Ng, where I learned:
			<ul>
				<li>Linear Algebra, Matlab/Octave</li>
				<li>Linear and Logistic Regression</li>	
				<li>Theory and Practical Advice of Neural Networks</li>
				<li>Support Vector Machines and their Kernels</li>
				<li>Principal Component Analysis for Dimensionality Reduction</li>
				<li>Anomaly Detection</li>
				<li>Recommender Systems</li>
				<li>Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization</li>
			</ul>
			<p>I applied this knowledge and used the algorithms in Python during two of my internships, where I used Scikit-Learn, Tensorflow, Keras and SQL.</p>
