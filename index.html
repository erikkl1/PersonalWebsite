				I'm Erik Klein. This is my digital CV and demo web page. About me:
				<ul>
					<li>Ex-Competitive Programmer</li>
					<li>Passionate Software Engineer</li>

			I'm a 19 year old from Germany and recently finished my Abiturs. I always loved thinking. From a young age, I got promoted by organizations for gifted students, like Hector-Seminar, Deutsche JuniorAkademien and Heidelberger Life-Science Lab, and discovered my interest and talent in computer science early. I started programming in 6th grade, and it captivated me since then. I always had the passion to solve problems, learn new technologies and build something visionary and useful. Since then, I've learned a lot and had a strong track-record, so that I consider myself able to perform sufficiently as a working student in a software development.

	<h2 class="after_two">Skills</h2>
	<h3>Algorithm Design</h3>
	I'm an expert at algorithm design, and able to come up with the best algorithms for complex problems. I was one of 20 German pupils to receive an extensive training in competitive programming as part of "IOI-Training" by Bundesweite Informatikwettbewerbe. This included three years of camps, lectures and practice contests.
